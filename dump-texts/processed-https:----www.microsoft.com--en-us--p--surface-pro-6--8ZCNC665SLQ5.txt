But both have no  thunderbolt 3, this surface pro 6 doesn't even have a usb-c for USB3.1??? Come on, Microsoft, you can ditch the low voltage CPU on surface book to get enough PCIE bandwidth. And easily put a extra USB-C on surface pro 6 since it have 12 lanes PCIE. Yes, I agree USB type-C may not be main stream in the next few years, but at least you should give us a thunderbolt 2 instead of a mini DisplayPort only port...As a professional user, we have surface dock which already have 2 mDP. So please, do not ditch traditional data transfers to force customers to use your OneDrive, I'm using it but please listen.19 out of 19 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:3/510/20/2018CodyMy surface literally arrived next day, I was pretty excited to get it running and see what it could handle. It was very sleek, light weight and easy to manage. I give it three stars due to Microsoft being incompetent and sending me a brand new broken surface pro. The touchscreen did not work at all, I am proficient with computers so I ran some updates to give it a chance but nothing worked. So it’s since been sent back. About 19 hundred spent and half of why owning a surface is so nice didn’t work.

I believe this may be an assault from other companies to effect the competitive sales of surface devices. There is only 1 one star review that is talking about sp6, and 4 that talk about previous generations. The average review is more like 4.5.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:1/511/3/2018KannanBeware of Surface Pro 4. It was my mistake to opt for Surface Pro 4 device, my hard-earned money USD1068 is wasted. I bought it during Nov 2016 but the surface hardware failed within 1.5 years, it failed to sustain long enough, reliability is very poor, display flickering problem, poor retention of charge. Microsoft replaced my original Surface Pro 4 device with piece of junk, used by someone, didn't know how long they used & refurbished, having some scratch after many consumers like me reported this big technical issue. I am not using this junk one now, afraid of another flickering and charging issue, headache of replacing it again&again, tilting towards Apple's Mac.

My advice is wait for a year and half to buy any future similar device and look for best reviews from consumers, any technical issues, spending USD1000+ is not easy but big company like Microsoft is not listening to their customers for proper replacement, Microsoft lost one of gadget loving best consumer like me.One person found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:/5Rating:/5Developer commentREPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentPreviousNextSurface All Access is the ultimate way to own a SurfaceGET STARTEDSign me upStay informed about special deals, the latest products, events, and more from Microsoft Store.By clicking sign up, I agree that I would like information, tips, and offers about Microsoft Store and other Microsoft products and services.
