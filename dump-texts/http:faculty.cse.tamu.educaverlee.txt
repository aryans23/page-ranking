James CaverleeHomePublicationsStudentsTeachingServiceAwardsJames CaverleeinfolabMy research targets topics from recommender systems, social media, information retrieval, data mining, emerging networked information systems, and occasional forays into distributed systems and services computing. I usually wear one of two hats in my work:


For many years, I have studied threats to these systems, including social spam/bots [ICWSM2011, SIGIR2010], crowd-powered strategic manipulation [SIGIR2015, WSDM2018], collective attention threats [ICWSM2013], attacks on search engines [PODC 2007], and other emerging threats [CIKM2016]. 
I'm also very interested in creating new beneficial algorithms and frameworks for these systems, including our work on geo-social characteristics of social media [WWW2013, ICWSM2011], user modeling [SIGIR2018, RecSys 2016], expert detection [RecSys2016, SIGIR2014], and geo-inferencing [CIKM2010]. 

My research approach is primarily data-driven and experimental in nature.

About me: I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2007, co-advised by Ling Liu (CS) and Bill Rouse (ISYE). Before that, I earned two M.S. degrees from Stanford University: one in Computer Science in 2001 and one in Engineering-Economic Systems & Operations Research in 2000. My undergraduate degree is a B.A. in Economics (magna cum laude) from Duke University in 1996. I joined the faculty at Texas A&M in 2007. I spent most of my sabbatical in 2015 at Google as a Visiting Scientist in Ed Chi's group. I've been honored to receive an NSF CAREER award, DARPA Young Faculty award, a AFOSR Young Investigator award, as well as several teaching awards.
