With CUDA, developers are able to dramatically speed up computing applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload runs on the CPU – which is optimized for single-threaded performance – while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and express parallelism through extensions in the form of a few basic keywords.The CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA provides everything you need to develop GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA Toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, a compiler, development tools and the CUDA runtime.CUDA ToolkitDownload NowThousands of applications developed with CUDA have been deployed to GPUs in embedded systems, workstations, datacenters and in the cloud.See More ApplicationsSee More ApplicationsCUDA serves as a common platform across all NVIDIA GPU families so you can deploy and scale your application across GPU configurations.The first GPUs were designed as graphics accelerators, becoming more programmable over the 90s, culminating in NVIDIA's first GPU in 1999. Researchers and scientists rapidly began to apply the excellent floating point performance of this GPU for general purpose computing. In 2003, a team of researchers led by Ian Buck unveiled Brook, the first widely adopted programming model to extend C with data-parallel constructs. Ian Buck later joined NVIDIA and led the launch of CUDA in 2006, the world's first solution for general-computing on GPUs.Since its inception, the CUDA ecosystem has grown rapidly to include software development tools, services and partner-based solutions. The CUDA Toolkit includes libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a compiler and a runtime library to deploy your application. You'll also find code samples, programming guides, user manuals, API references and other documentation to help you get started.CUDA ToolkitcuRANDNPPMath LibrarycuFFTnvGRAPHNCCLSee More LibrariesSee More LibrariesNsightVisual ProfilerCUDA GDBCUDA MemCheckOpenACCCUDA Profiling Tools InterfaceSee More ToolsSee More ToolsCUDA accelerates applications across a wide range of domains from image processing, to deep learning, numerical analytics and computational science.More ApplicationsMore ApplicationsGet started with CUDA by downloading the CUDA Toolkit and exploring introductory resources including videos, code samples, hands-on labs and webinars.Download NowDownload NowGet Started with CUDAGet Started with CUDAAccelerated Computing NewsRead moreNVIDIA RTX Top 3: Week of November 30, 2018Every week, we’ll be delivering 3 interesting stories coming from the world of RTX Game Development.Read moreRead moreRead moreNVIDIA Opening Core AI and ML Research Lab in Santa ClaraTo help accelerate AI research and further discovery across deep learning sciences, the NVIDIA Research team is announcing the opening of a core AI/ML lab in Santa Clara, California.Read moreRead moreRead moreDeep Learning Helps Doctors Classify Breast Cancer TumorsIn the United States, there are over 3.1 million women with a history of breast cancer.  This year, over 266,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.Read moreRead moreRead moreNVIDIA AI Software Now Available on AWS MarketplaceOver the last several years, NVIDIA has sought to democratize AI.Read moreRead moreParallel ForAll BlogRead moreParallel Shader Compilation for Ray Tracing Pipeline StatesIn ray tracing, a single pipeline state object (PSO) can contain any number of shaders.
