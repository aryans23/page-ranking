These autonomous machines are driving exciting new capabilities—from streamlining warehouses and inspecting lengths of hard-to-access power lines in real time to aiding in search and rescue operations in difficult terrain. NVIDIA® Jetson™ is the platform that makes it possible.deep learningNVIDIA® Jetson™Aerialtronics is a manufacturer of technologically advanced drones for the commercial market that uses Jetson and deep learning software from Neurala. The company relies on a fully automated drone workflow for the safe inspection of cell towers, power lines, wind turbines, and other infrastructure. Cell tower operators can dramatically increase safety, lower costs, and collect more accurate data.Marc Gyongyosi is the founder of a startup, IFM, that's developed a Jetson-powered autonomous drone. The company first unveiled its indoor navigation technology at NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference in April 2016, and is now staking a claim in the $5 billion warehouse analytics industry.Read MoreIntelligent Flying Machines (IFM) is a data analytics company using computer vision and robotics to automate data capture. Using Jetson technology makes IFM’s flying robots small, light and agile enough to zip through the corridors and tight spaces of a warehouse.
