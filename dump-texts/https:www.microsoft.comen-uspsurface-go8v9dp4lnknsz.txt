Great for the size and the sd slot for the extra storage took care of my only concern. Great for the price.57 out of 59 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/58/30/2018JAMESMy history since the 1990’s with laptops and tablets for business is simple. Owned the first generation Panasonic toteable… frequent crashes and heavy….. traded it for an iPad….no mouse, no track pad, bad keyboards sold separately, MS Office needs a mouse and keyboard …bought a Yoga…everything great except the size – try showing a Power Point on a
client’s messy desk with a 14” computer.

Then I purchased the Microsoft Surface Go with the works…128GB, Platinum Keyboard with matching Mouse and Pen. I had a C-Hub, which works with this
unit.

The Go is the ultimate laptop for business people away from the office. Working in a metropolitan area Wi-Fi is everywhere.

I not only show my Power Points, but multitask with windows word, excel and email with no lag. I use canned word business letters, insert names and addresses, insert excel pricing for quotes and email them as attached PDF files.

Not for high intensity programs.37 out of 38 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/59/1/2018ChelseaI just received my Surface Go yesterday, I got all blue accessories and it looks great. The only drawback is that it has a huge bezel around the screen. In order to add more apps to my task bar, I had to make it smaller as well. If anyone remembers the netbooks from about ten years ago, this is the new equivalent. I remember when I had my original netbook, I put the full version of windows on it and it ran fine, and never really slowed down. I am a little scared to take my Surface Go out of S mode because it is irreversible. However, it is fast for the price. It is not replacing my desktop, but is an added addition. Because I am a student and needed something light, portable, and more functional than my iPad, I went with this. If you can get over the large bezel, and remember that this is a functioning computer, not a tablet; this is a great choice.44 out of 46 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/59/2/2018KYUNGHOToday, I tested this and ipad pro. Surface go has so much more potential than ipad. I have no idea how people pay so much money for ipad and get way less than a regular laptop. New pen works wonderfully with any surface devices. I would choose this surface go or surface over ipad pro.17 out of 17 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/59/8/2018TimBrought the Go primarily for my daughter and now I fight with her all the time to use it haha. This little Surface really kicks butt! She's in 4th grade so I wanted something that was small and light enough for her while allowing her the best opportunity to fully assist her in her school and creative work. An iPad just wasn't going to cut it, the lack of ports alone and the inability to expand the storage were huge factors. Back lit keyboard, very responsive pen, expandable storage, and the fact that it runs a full OS really made this a no brainer for me.

I've set up her start screen with school and play groups, I've pinned all her books from the Nook app into a folder on start, made the i-Ready webpage (which her school uses) it's own tile for the start screen as well. I've had no issues with it at all. We both love it.13 out of 13 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/59/1/2018Andrew BMy Surface Go is so useful! For the past two years, I have been using my iPad Pro for most everything. On the whole, I have been quite happy with it. However, there was many a time that I needed a file explorer or better connectivity with an eco-system beyond Apple to get work done.

Although the iPad Pro was fluid and smooth for what it could do, it was limited and limiting in getting office and network work done.

Enter the Suface Go: sure it may not be as smooth or quick, but at the end of the day, because it has a full OS, I was able to get all of my work done on the Go.

I now spend more time with the Go and am depending more and more on it than my iPad Pro.18 out of 19 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:3/59/11/2018MTheoretically a good device. Format is great for holding extended periods of time, does most basic functions very well. Good to have such a portable device with Windows OS. However, battery lasts about 4-5 hours in basic non CPU intensive functions and with screen at about 50%. The device had 8GB of ram and still could not handle more than 4 Chrome tabs open while browsing. On tab 5 scrolling and page response began to suffer. By tab 6 and 7 scrolling is just unbearable. Not sure if its a CPU issue or something else. None of the updates resolved the issue. 
Win 10 needs a touch more work to be more suited for touch interface, no pun intended. At times difficult to select menus and icons with a finger. Scaling needs to be increased by 50% but at that point screen space begins to suffer were even OS screens do not fit the 10 inch display.
Could be great, but not quite there. Perhaps if the CPU was better I could learn to deal with the rest.15 out of 16 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/59/7/2018TateThis computer is perfect for students in college! I am a graduate student who works as a teacher during the day, and at night I am in school of my own. This computer is the perfect size to take on the go. The screen looks amazing, and using the pen to take notes is smooth. If you are looking for a gaming or video editing beast this is not the machine you want. If you want portability with great power for school/work, lite editing, and gaming this is what you have been waiting for.13 out of 14 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:2/59/5/2018YosefGood laptop. 8GB/128GB model. Alacantera keyboard.

As a college student working with desks about the size of my hand, the small size is perfect - excellent for use while sitting on buses. Pen capability (first time using anything with such a novelty) is tremendously useful for notetaking, scribbling, doodling, highlighting. Almost everything's in a .pdf these days. Smooth, comfortable keyboard. Everything's magnetic (check it out in stores)!

But. A few gripes.

Taskbar is rather small. Fairly massive bezel, which is becoming more and more a matter of import these days. 
And, my biggest peeve. Battery. The battery on the Surface Go is incredibly weak. I usually have Spotify, Skype, and WhatsApp open. I have maybe three or four tabs open in Edge, very simple, clean websites (simpler than Microsoft's). My battery, with battery saver on, darker screen, can go to FOUR hours. They say nine, reviewers say six, but it's four. At least for me. Taking my charger everywhere isn't fun.26 out of 30 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/58/30/2018DougVery happy so far. Snappy performance (8GB,128GB model) for everyday tasks. I bought the Alcantera keyboard and mobile mouse.  A great mobile solution. I even tried a few older games and it worked great. I've never purchased a Surface product before but am very happy with the build quality and performance.  I only wish they could have squeezed a larger battery in. Battery life can very quite a bit depending on what you're doing with it but I am generally getting around 7 hours.  Thanks Microsoft for a great product!16 out of 18 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:/5Rating:/5Developer commentREPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentPreviousNextStudents, parents and military save up to 10%CHECK NOWSurface Go Essentials BundleSHOP NOWSurface All Access is the ultimate way to own a SurfaceGET STARTEDSurface Go Essentials BundleSHOP NOWBundle and saveSHOP NOW[*] Type Cover, Surface Dial, Microsoft Office, Surface Pen, and some software and accessories sold separately.Windows.com/SmodeFAQSurface.com/StoragePre-Order PolicySign me upStay informed about special deals, the latest products, events, and more from Microsoft Store.By clicking sign up, I agree that I would like information, tips, and offers about Microsoft Store and other Microsoft products and services.
