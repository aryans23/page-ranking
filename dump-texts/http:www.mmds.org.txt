Additional information and registration.information and registrationThe 3rd edition of the book (v3.0 beta)We are developing the third edition of the book.
You can see the current state of the new edition, along with a description
of the changes so far here.hereThe 2nd edition of the book (v2.1)The following is the second edition of the book. There are three new chapters, on mining large graphs, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning. There is also a revised Chapter 2 that treats map-reduce programming in a manner closer to how it is used in practice.Together with each chapter there is aslo a set of lecture slides that we use for teaching Stanford CS246: Mining 
  Massive Datasets course. Note that the slides do not necessarily cover all the material convered in the corresponding chapters.CS246: Mining

The emphasis is on Map Reduce as a tool for creating parallel algorithms that can process very large amounts of data.CS246: Mining Massive DatasetsCS341 Project in Mining Massive Data Sets is an advanced project based course. Students work on data mining and machine learning algorithms for analyzing very large amounts of data. Both interesting big datasets as well as computational infrastructure (large MapReduce cluster) are provided by course staff.
  Generally, students first take CS246 followed by CS341.CS341 Project in Mining Massive Data SetsCS246CS341CS341 is generously supported by 
  Amazon by giving us access to their 
  EC2 platform.CS341AmazonEC2CS224W: Social and Information Networks is graduate level course that covers recent research on the structure and analysis of such large social and information networks and on models and algorithms that abstract their basic properties. Class explores how to practically analyze large scale network data and how to reason about it through models for network structure and evolution.CS224W: Social and Information NetworksIf you are not a Stanford student, you can still take CS246 as well as CS224W  or earn a 
  
  Stanford Mining Massive Datasets graduate certificate by completing a sequence of four Stanford Computer Science courses. A graduate certificate is a great way to keep the skills and knowledge in your field current.
