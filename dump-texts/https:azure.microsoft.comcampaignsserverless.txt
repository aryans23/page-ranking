With serverless in Azure, provisioning, scaling, and management of resources is handled for you.Start freeBuild applications without worrying about serversFocus on the business logic for your applications while infrastructure management is handled for you. Serverless in Azure means faster time to market with lower infrastructure and operating costs.Take advantage of fully managed servicesServerless is the abstraction of servers, but that’s just the beginning of the value that building serverless computing solutions on Azure provides. Take advantage of innovative programming models unique to Azure, that simplify event-driven computing. Use a rich set of managed services for data, messaging, and intelligence to create scalable, highly available applications. Enable your teams to focus on solving business problems, rather than repetitive infrastructure management.Increase productivity with an end-to-end development experienceServerless is a new way of building applications, and it requires modern tools. Azure offers a comprehensive set of development, deployment, and management tools. Local development and debugging through Visual Studio or the Azure CLI, continuous deployment through Azure DevOps tools, and live monitoring through Application Insights combine to deliver ultimate end-to-end developer productivity in the cloud.Build on an open source foundationServerless in Azure builds on an open source foundation, the core of which is Azure Functions, an event-driven compute experience and open source project. Community contributions include support for new languages, integrations, and deployment targets. Azure is also the only cloud to support open-standard CloudEvents. Event-driven applications are now possible using CloudEvents with the Event Grid event-routing service.Azure Functionsopen source projectCloudEvents with the Event GridRun your serverless solutions anywhereFunctions can be used on-premises, in hybrid environments like Azure Stack, on IoT Edge devices, and deployed on top of orchestrators such as Kubernetes—as well as in other clouds. Gain flexibility in deployment options, the ability to reuse code, and the ability to rely on the same productive programming model irrespective of deployment target.Get inspired with a full day of technical keynotes, demos, and live-coding sessions for developers, by developers.Join onlineCustomers are doing great things with serverless in AzureExamples of serverless applications possible in AzureOnline orders are picked up from a queue, processed, and resulting data is stored in a database.A mobile application user updates a shared task list which triggers notifications for other users.Patient records are securely uploaded as PDF files. That data is then decomposed, processed using optical character recognition (OCR) detection, and added to a database for easy queries.Telemetry data gets collected from an IoT device. That data is processed in near real-time and stored in a database for use in an analytics dashboard.Build your serverless applications with AzureEnjoy freedom from infrastructure management no matter what type of application you’re building or technologies you’re using. With Azure, get your choice of serverless execution environments, a set of fully managed services, and productive developer tools to build your applications.Serverless execution environmentsExecute code, written in the language of your choice, with Azure Functions, an event-driven compute experience. Scale on demand and pay only for the time your code is executed. Available as a managed service in Azure and Azure Stack, the open source Functions runtime also works on multiple destinations like Kubernetes, IoT Edge, on-premises, or even in other clouds.Azure Functionsopen source Functions runtimeA first-of-its-kind service, Azure Container Instances allows you to securely run containers on demand.
