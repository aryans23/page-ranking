This makes it easy to add AI into robots for perception, navigation 
   
    and
    manipulation. It also provides a framework to manage communications and transfer data within the robot architecture.Part of the SDK is Isaac Sim, a simulation environment for developing, testing and training autonomous machines in the virtual world. The algorithms trained in 
   
    simulation
    are then deployed to NVIDIA® Jetson AGX XavierTM , bringing robots to life.NVIDIA® Jetson AGX XavierTMFEATURED CASE STUDYLowe’s Home Improvement uses robotics to improve customer service and help employees get more done. LoweBot NAVii, an autonomous retail service robot built by Fellow Robots, uses voice recognition and an integrated touchscreen to answer basic customer questions, plus Jetson-powered computer vision to automate inventory taking. This frees store employees to deliver personalized service and take on back-of-house projects. Watch the video to learn more about the retail robot that’s helping Lowe’s build a better retail experience.GET STARTED WITH INDUSTRY-LEADING EMBEDDED SOLUTIONS.CONTACT USFROM OUR BLOGRobotics Reimagined: NVIDIA Releases Isaac SDK to Accelerate Creating Autonomous MachinesThe robotics revolution just shifted into high gear.
