It delivers industry-leading performance and energy-efficient computing for the development and production of functionally safe AI-powered cars, trucks, robotaxis, and shuttles. DRIVE AGX systems are all built on a single architecture, taking advantage of the NVIDIA DRIVE software stack to scale from traffic jam pilots to fully autonomous operation.self-driving vehiclesNVIDIA DRIVELearn MoreIntelligent MachinesThe NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™ is a first-of-its-kind computer that gives you unprecedented processing power to drive computationally intensive applications for AI at the edge. Now, you can get the performance of a GPU workstation in a compact form factor with the highest level of performance at or under 30W. Jetson AGX Xavier brings AI to embedded applications across nearly every industry. Its energy-efficient productivity and powerful SDKs make it ideal for developing robots, drones, and other autonomous machines that demand maximum compute of up to 32 TOPS for deep learning tasks.autonomous machinesLearn MoreIntelligent MachinesThe NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™ is a first-of-its-kind computer that gives you unprecedented processing power to drive computationally intensive applications for AI at the edge.
