A Clara developer can engage with the SDK at any level to create world class applications that can be scaled in a customer’s environment.Clara AGX is the world’s first AI computer for autonomous medical instruments. AGX is NVIDIA’s family of systems for autonomous machines. Clara AGX is remarkable because it has 6 different accelerators - a Volta GPU, an ARM CPU, a deep learning acceleration engine, a programmable vision accelerator, a video processing engine, and an image signal processor. The Clara AGX architecture the same underlying chip used by Drive AGX Pegasus, the NVIDIA platform for autonomous vehicles.The Clara platform aims to bring the technological advances that have been proven in other industries, like gaming, autonomous cars, and consumer cloud computing, to the medical imaging industry.Apply For AccessNVIDIA Clara SDKNVIDIA Clara AGXNVIDIA Clara DevelopersStart building your healthcare application using CLARA pre-packaged containers focused on Accelerated Computing, Visualization, and Artificial IntelligenceWith Clara embedded and Clara Server, you can reimagine the possibilities of the medical workflowBy leveraging Docker and NVIDIA’s Kubernetes on GPUs , you will be able to deploy your application in multiple compute environments, including embedded, on-prem, or in the cloudKubernetes on GPUsAI: DALI, CuDNN, TRT, TRT Inference Server, Inference Manager, V-Net
