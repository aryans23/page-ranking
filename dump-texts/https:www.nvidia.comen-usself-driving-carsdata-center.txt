But this demands an infrastructure capable of training thousands of hours of data and millions of images using deep learning and AI, as well as labeling of hundreds of thousands of images.autonomous vehiclesACCELERATE TRAINING WITH AI COMPUTINGIt takes a high-performance, energy-efficient AI computing infrastructure to create the future of autonomous vehicles . The key to success is optimizing the data load for training and operating these vehicles without compromising safety. The more information that cars are can gather and process, the faster and better AI can learn and make decisions.autonomous vehiclesScaling your data center with GPU-powered NVIDIA® DGX™ Systems is the best way to build an AI infrastructure that can deliver safe autonomous vehicles to consumers. NVIDIA DGX-1 is an AI supercomputer that makes training and management of deep learning algorithms effortless. It delivers 3X faster training speed than other GPU-based systems—and works right out of the box.NVIDIA® DGX™ SystemsThese industry-leading systems do more than allow rapid model development at scale. DGX provides dramatic savings for AI and deep learning infrastructure, replacing hundreds of CPU servers, while being 60X smaller and 18X more power efficient.NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)Zenuity is using a scalable AI platform to accelerate development of smarter, safer autonomous vehicles.
