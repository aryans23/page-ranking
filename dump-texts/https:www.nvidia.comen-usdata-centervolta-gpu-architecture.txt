It exists in fields of supercomputing, healthcare, financial services, big data analytics, and gaming. It is the future of every industry and market because every enterprise needs intelligence, and the engine of AI is the NVIDIA GPU computing platform.NVIDIA Volta is the new driving force behind artificial intelligence. Volta will fuel breakthroughs in every industry. Humanity’s moonshots like eradicating cancer, intelligent customer experiences, and self-driving vehicles are within reach of this next era of AI.Groundbreaking InnovationsAn Exponential Leap in PerformanceEvery industry needs AI, and with this massive leap forward in speed, AI can now be applied to every industry. Equipped with 640 Tensor Cores, Volta delivers over 125 teraFLOPs per second (TFLOPS) of deep learning performance, over a 5X increase compared to prior generation NVIDIA Pascal™ architecture.Tensor CoresEngineered for the Modern ComputerHumanity’s greatest challenges will require the most powerful computing engine for both computational and data science. With over 21 billion transistors, Volta is the most powerful GPU architecture the world has ever seen. It pairs NVIDIA® CUDA® and Tensor Cores to deliver the performance of an AI supercomputer in a GPU.Scalability for Rapid Time-to-SolutionVolta uses next generation revolutionary NVIDIA NVLink™ high-speed interconnect technology. This delivers 2X the throughput, compared to the previous generation of NVLink. This enables more advanced model and data parallel approaches for strong scaling to achieve the absolute highest application performance.GPU-Accelerated Frameworks and ApplicationsData scientists are often forced to make trade-offs between model accuracy and longer run-times. With Volta-optimized CUDA and NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK libraries like cuDNN, NCCL, and TensorRT, the industry’s top frameworks and applications can easily tap into the power of Volta. This propels data scientists and researchers towards discoveries faster than before.NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK librariescuDNNTensorRTVOLTA PRODUCT LITERATUREEnormous Savings with Volta InfographicVolta WhitepaperVolta AI InfographicVolta HPC InfographicV100 Datasheet3 Reasons WhyV100 Performance GuideNVIDIA® Tesla® V100, the Most Advanced AI GPU Ever Built.Learn MoreNVIDIA T4NVIDIA Tesla V100NVIDIA Tesla P100NVIDIA Tesla P4/P40NVIDIA DGX SystemsNVIDIA DGX StationNVIDIA DGX-1NVIDIA DGX-2NVIDIA HGXNVIDIA GPU CloudNVIDIA VoltaNVIDIA PascalNVLink/NVSwitchTensor CoresIndeX ParaView PluginData Center BlogsGPU-Ready App Quick Start GuidesGPU Apps CatalogTesla Product LiteratureGPU Test DriveWhere to Buy - DGXWhere to Buy - TeslaQualified Server CatalogSubscribeGet the Latest from NVIDIA
