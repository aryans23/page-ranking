And it's been an amazing device. Display, using touchscreen and especially typing is very comfortable. It does lacks the battery which is specified by Microsoft. But overall an amazing product. Would definitely recommend it.5 out of 5 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/510/20/2018OsperitasIt does everything I wanted and more. As someone that travels a great deal I needed a light weight and affordable laptop. I have been very happy with the battery life and screen. 5* Product.12 out of 15 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/510/31/2018MarioAmazing build quality and software quality. I'm coming from a MacBook pro and this exceeds it easily. It's fast while feeling like a luxury product. Would recommend! I am not sure about the i5 model, but the i7 is great.4 out of 4 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/511/5/2018RichardThe pictures do not do justice to how thin this laptop is!  My only advice would be to hold one in the store (ideally closed) to get a real sense the dimensions.  The edges are chiseled and, when carrying, easy hold this laptop.  I have the black Surface 2 and am impressed with the small footprint and stability.
  I closed the laptop and put it next to my iPad Pro which has the Apple type cover-for all practical purposes, the thickness is close.
 The screen is beautiful and the keyboard excellent-I am writing this review on the Surface 2 (instead of doing my actual work-that's another story).  I was torn between this and the Surface Pro 6 but chose this laptop so I could put it on my lap when sitting without a desk (OK, I'll just say it-I sometimes use my laptop while watching TV).   I was tempted to wait for the MacBook Air (the newest one) but, this has the lightness and sleekness so I made the right decision.  Pick up the laptop-you'll see what I mean :)3 out of 3 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/511/3/2018MiguelSimply a beautiful and powerful laptop!3 out of 3 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/510/19/2018AKNSthis is a great product13 out of 19 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:5/511/10/2018LuisMicrosoft Surface Laptop 2, is one of the most exciting machine I bought. Slim, quiet and fast; love Alcantara sensation to touch to work confortable all day.2 out of 2 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:3/511/15/2018J.I bought a Surface Laptop last year. It's fast, handy (great for hand luggage)- but blue screen occasion occurred during the first 4 months of purchase while running simultaneous programs such as  Excel multiple sheets and heavy Powerpoint slides. Technical support worked on my laptop and reduced the frequency of blue screen occasion. My major issue is the leathery panel that attracts dirt and moisture. I travel overseas a lot with my laptop- and exposure to dirt and moist is unavoidable. My laptop, though new- looks old. I agree on the issue with Customer Service. Agent seem to be working on many other issues at the same time (some admitted so), that it takes many minutes to wait for a short answer.6 out of 9 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:1/511/11/2018SamiGive me a break: 1 x full-size USB 3.0 and Mini DisplayPort, but NO USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port ???10 out of 30 people found this helpful.REPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentRating:/5Rating:/5Developer commentREPORTContains spam or advertisingContains profanityContains offensive contentPreviousNextSurface All Access is the ultimate way to own a SurfaceGET STARTEDSign me upStay informed about special deals, the latest products, events, and more from Microsoft Store.By clicking sign up, I agree that I would like information, tips, and offers about Microsoft Store and other Microsoft products and services.
