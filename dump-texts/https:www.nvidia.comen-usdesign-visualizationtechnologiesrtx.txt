NVIDIA has enhanced its RTX development platform with new AI, ray tracing and simulation SDKs, to take full advantage of Turing’s capabilities. The result? Incredible designs, highly realistic simulations and stunning visual effects —faster than ever before.RTXdevelopment platformNVIDIA RTX PlatformCORE TECHNOLOGIESThe RTX platform realizes the dream of real-time cinematic-quality rendering through Turing-optimized ray tracing APIs such as NVIDIA OptiX, Microsoft DXR and Vulkan. The ability to render photorealistic objects and environments in real time, with perfectly accurate shadows, reflections and refractions, now makes it possible for artists and designers to create amazing content faster than ever before.The RTX platform features the new NGX SDK to infuse powerful AI-enhanced capabilities into visual applications. This dramatically accelerates creativity for artists and designers by freeing up time and resources through intelligent manipulation of images, automation of repetitive tasks, and optimization of compute-intensive processes.The RTX platform features new Turing-based advances in programmable shading such as variable-rate shading, texture-space shading and multi-view rendering. These enable the creation of richer visuals with more fluid interactivity with large models and scenes, and improved VR experiences.Lifelike visuals are the result of not only how something looks, but also of how it behaves. With the power of Turing CUDA cores and APIs such as NVIDIA’s PhysX, FleX and CUDA 10, the RTX platform enables accurate modelling of the behavior of real-world objects in everything from games to virtual environments and special effects.The RTX Platform supports industry standards such as Universal Scene Description (USD) from Pixar and the open-source NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL) to provide efficient asset interchange between applications and maximizes productivity for artists and designers.NVIDIA TURINGThe NVIDIA Turing GPU architecture is the engine powering the RTX platform.LEARN MORENVIDIA TURINGThe NVIDIA Turing GPU architecture is the engine powering the RTX platform.LEARN MORENVIDIA TURINGThe NVIDIA Turing GPU architecture is the engine powering the RTX platform.LEARN MOREDEVELOPER ACCESSThe NVIDIA RTX platform empowers developers to redefine what’s possible in computer graphics, video, and imaging.
