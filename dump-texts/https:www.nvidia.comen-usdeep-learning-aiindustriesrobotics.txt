AI makes it possible for robots to perceive and interact with their environments in novel ways, enabling them to take on tasks that were unthinkable--until now.NVIDIA Isaac—The Platform for RoboticsThere are endless opportunities for robots to create new efficiencies and improve quality of life through industries such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and service. NVIDIA Isaac accelerates the process with enhanced robotics development, simulation, and deployment.The NVIDIA Isaac Software Development Kit (SDK) gives you a comprehensive set of frameworks, tools, APIs, and libraries to accelerate development of robotics algorithms and software.The runtime framework is tightly integrated with Isaac Sim and designed for developing production-quality, AI-enabled solutions optimized for deployment on NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™.NVIDIA® Jetson AGXXavier™Isaac Gem applications are a collection of NVIDIA-developed robotics algorithm software. They’re ideal for solving common challenges in developing solutions for perception, navigation, manipulation, and control.These turnkey applications are compatible with the Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim and can save months of development time and effort.Isaac Sim lets developers train and test their robot software using highly realistic virtual simulation environments. Engineering iterations and testing can be done in minutes—tasks that would otherwise take months to perform. And because the system is completely virtual, there’s no risk of damage or injury.Isaac Sim is fully integrated with the Isaac SDK, which enables hardware-in-the-loop testing with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.NVIDIA Jetson AGX XavierJetson AGX Xavier is the world's first computer expressly designed for robotics. With more than nine billion transistors, it delivers 32 deep learning TOPS (trillion operations per second), greater than 10x the energy efficiency and more than 20X the performance of its predecessor Jetson TX2.Robots need to be able to understand the world around them using a wide range of sensors. Jetson AGX Xavier enables this with six high-performance processing units—a 512-core NVIDIA Volta architecture Tensor Core GPU, an eight-core Carmel ARM64 CPU, a dual NVDLA deep learning accelerator, and image, vision, and video processors.Buy NowFind out more about this unique solution.Contact UsLATEST ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING FOR ROBOTICSRobotics Reimagined: NVIDIA Releases Isaac SDK to Accelerate Creating Autonomous MachinesRobotics Reimagined: NVIDIA Releases Isaac SDK to Accelerate Creating Autonomous MachinesThe robotics revolution just shifted into high gear.
