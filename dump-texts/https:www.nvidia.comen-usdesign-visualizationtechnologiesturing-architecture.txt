Together, for the first time, they make real-time ray tracing possible, opening up amazing creative possibilities that until recently were assumed to be years away.Watch VideoTURING INNOVATIONSThe Turing architecture is armed with dedicated ray-tracing processors called RT Cores that accelerate the computation of how light and sound travel in 3D environments by up to 10 Giga Rays per second. Turing accelerates real-time ray tracing by 25X over the previous-generation NVIDIA Pascal™ and can render final frames for film effects more than 30X faster than CPUs.Turing features new Tensor Cores, processors that accelerate deep learning training and inference, providing up to 500 trillion tensor operations per second. This level of performance dramatically accelerates AI-enhanced features—such as denoising, resolution scaling, and video re-timing—creating applications with powerful new capabilities.The Turing architecture dramatically improves raster performance over the previous-generation Pascal with an enhanced graphics pipeline and new programmable shading technologies. These technologies include variable-rate shading, texture-space shading, and multi-view rendering, which enable more fluid interactivity with large models and scenes and improved virtual reality experiences.virtual realityTuring-based GPUs feature a new streaming multiprocessor (SM) architecture that supports up to 16 trillion floating-point operations in parallel with 16 trillion integer operations per second. Developers can take advantage of up to 4,608 CUDA cores with NVIDIA CUDA 10, FleX, and PhysX software development kits (SDKs) to create complex simulations, such as particle or fluid dynamics for scientific visualization, virtual environments, and special effects.NVIDIA CUDA 10TURING PRODUCT LITERATURETuring White PaperLEARN MOREQuadro in Desktop WorkstationsQuadro in Mobile WorkstationsQuadro in Specialty SolutionsQuadro in Virtual WorkspacesNVIDIA GRIDNVIDIA TITAN XpQuadro Product LiteratureVirtual GPU Product LiteratureCustomer Success StoriesOn-Demand WebinarsBlogsIray Dev BlogNVIDIA GRID Community AdvisorsVirtual GPU ForumAdvanced Rendering ForumDeveloper ForumFacebookTwitterLinkedInYouTube<img class="global-footer__region__icon" src="/etc/designs/nvidiaGDC/clientlibs_base/images/country-selector/us.png" />
