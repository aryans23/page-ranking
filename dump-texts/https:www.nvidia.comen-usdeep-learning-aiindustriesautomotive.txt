AI adds a robust layer of safety, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears when a driver’s attention is focused elsewhere. It can take over driving tasks, allowing riders to focus on work or entertainment. It can make travel more efficient, finding optimal routes and easing traffic congestion. Taken together, these benefits can dramatically transform transportation, turning the car from just a vehicle to an entirely new space to live and work.Thanks to advances in deep learning and GPU development, this new era of travel will be possible sooner. Companies are integrating AI into every level of vehicle design, manufacturing and driving.NVIDIA DRIVE™ PlatformScalable AI Car Computer for Self-Driving VehiclesLearn more >Learn more >NVIDIA DGX SYSTEMSAccelerating AI implementation and insightsLearn more >Learn more >Explore the latest GPU deep learning innovations for the automotive industry.LEARN MORELATEST ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING FOR AUTOMOTIVEHOW DRIVE IX HELPS HUMANS STAY FOCUSEDIncorporating AI into the vehicle cockpit can add a robust layer of safety, ensuring drivers stay focused, or taking action if they aren’t paying attention.Read more >Read more >ACCELERATED DESIGN AND MANUFACTURINGWhether you're creating innovative products or groundbreaking architecture, NVIDIA professional graphics will improve the performance of your design application.See how >See how >PROPEL YOUR AUTOMOTIVE AI STARTUPAre you an AI startup advancing the automotive industry?
