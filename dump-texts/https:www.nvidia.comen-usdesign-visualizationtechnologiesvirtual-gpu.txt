Amp up the power of your VDI environment and deliver a superior experience to every remote user, for every application and on any device. NVIDIA virtual GPU software products include the GRID Virtual PC (GRID vPC), GRID Virtual Apps (GRID vApps), and Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation (Quadro vDWS). Each is designed to deliver the highest levels of performance, flexibility, manageability, and security—offering the right user experience for every virtual workflow.GRID Virtual PC (GRID vPC)GRID Virtual Apps (GRID vApps)Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation (Quadro vDWS)QUADRO vDWS FOR CREATORS & ENGINEERSIn a VDI environment powered by NVIDIA virtual GPU, the NVIDIA virtual GPU software is installed at the virtualization layer along with the hypervisor. The NVIDIA virtual GPU software creates virtual GPUs enabling every virtual machine (VM) to share the physical GPU installed on the server. The NVIDIA virtualization software includes a graphics driver for every VM. Quadro vDWS includes for example, the powerful Quadro driver. Because work that was typically done by the CPU is offloaded to the GPU, the user has a much better experience, and demanding engineering and creative applications can now be supported in a virtualized and cloud environment.NVIDIA virtual GPU solutions offer end-to-end insights across your entire virtualization stack, allowing you to create, deploy, and support at large scale with lower TCO. Get management and monitoring of the GPU at the host, VM, and application level for quick resolution of issues and proactive management. With the integration of GPU and virtual GPU metrics with your existing VDI management tools, you can manage your entire infrastructure from a single view.Learn MoreNVIDIA virtual GPU has three different products designed to let you assign the right level of resources to each of your users based on their exact needs.NVIDIA QUADRO vDWSFor professional graphics applications; includes an NVIDIA Quadro driver.NVIDIA GRID vPCFor virtual desktops delivering standard PC applications, browser, and multimedia.NVIDIA GRID vAPPSUse with Citrix XenApp or other RDSH solutions like VMware Horizon Apps.Read the NVIDIA GRID vPC Solution BriefRead the NVIDIA Quadro vDWS Solution BriefRead the NVIDIA GRID vPC Solution BriefRead the NVIDIA Quadro vDWS Solution BriefMeet the members of our NVIDIA Virtual GPU Community Advisor Program.
